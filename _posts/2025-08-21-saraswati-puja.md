Every year, our community comes together to celebrate **Saraswati Puja**, also known as *Vasant Panchami*. This festival honors **Goddess Saraswati**, the divine embodiment of knowledge, wisdom, music, and the arts.  

While Durga Puja brings us grandeur and devotion in autumn, Saraswati Puja holds a more intimate charm — especially for students and learners. Books, instruments, and tools of learning are placed before the goddess as a symbolic offering, reflecting our respect for the pursuit of knowledge.

## The Spirit of Saraswati Puja  

For children and youth, Saraswati Puja carries special importance. Dressed in traditional attire, they participate in the rituals, seek blessings, and present cultural performances. The day is filled with **songs, dances, recitations, and musical showcases**, celebrating both devotion and creativity.  

In our community abroad, the Puja also becomes a bridge between generations — reminding the young of their roots while giving elders the joy of passing on traditions.
