# Welcome to Saskatoon Durga Puja Celebration Committee (SDPCC)

For more than five decades, the Saskatoon Durga Puja Celebration Committee has been a vibrant cultural hub for Bengalis and friends of Bengal living in Saskatoon and beyond. What began as a small gathering of families has today grown into a cherished community, celebrating our heritage, traditions, and values with pride.

Our central focus has always been to keep the spirit of Bengali culture alive, especially for the younger generations growing up away from Bengal. Through festivals, cultural programs, and community initiatives, we come together to share the joy of traditions, strengthen our bonds, and build lifelong memories.

The SDPCC is more than a festival committee—it is a family. We welcome people from diverse backgrounds who share a love for culture, music, art, and community spirit. Whether you are a newcomer to Saskatoon or a long-time resident, you will always find warmth, connection, and belonging here.  

We encourage everyone to participate actively—be it through volunteering, contributing ideas, or simply joining in to celebrate with us. Every hand, every smile, and every shared moment adds to the strength of our community.
