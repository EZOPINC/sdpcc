# Welcome to SDPCC

For over 55 years, **SDPCC** has been the cultural home for Bengalis and friends of Bengali people in Saskatoon.  
We come together to celebrate our traditions, share joy, and pass on the spirit of community to future generations.  

✨ Festivals, music, food, and friendships — our story is about belonging, togetherness, and pride in our heritage and culture.
