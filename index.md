# Welcome to SDPCC

The **Saskatoon Durga Puja Celebration Committee (SDPCC)** is a cultural community organization based in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.  
We have been celebrating **Durga Puja, Saraswati Puja, and other cultural events** for over 55 years.

Our community brings together families and individuals to celebrate Bengali traditions, share our culture, and create lasting memories.
