# Forums 

This is a forum where our members will keep posting about the history and upcoming functions.
Also collaboration with different cultural society is in progress now and we will update once we get consent from HSS and other community to publish their names and use their logo and names in the partnerships section.

Also if you want any cultural events or religious events to be published here please do let us know.
